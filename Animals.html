      <h2>Me and my pets</h2>
      <p>"I don't understand people who don't touch their pets. Their Cats and Dogs are called a pet for a reason." -Jarud Kintz(author) <br>I think dogs are the most amazing creatures;they give unconditional love. </p>
      <p> A cat's brain is biologically more similar to ahuman brain than it is to a dog's.Both humans and cats have identical regions in their brains that are responsible for emotions.cats make about 100 different sounds while dogs make only about 10.Cats are highly sensitive to vibrations and may able to detect earthquake tremores 10 or 15 minuts before humans  </p>

  <p> I like art. You can express your inner feeling using art. The art of painting is bigger than speaking.Below there are drawings ;You may think that it is my work but those are drawn by others that are given to me as a gift. </p>
